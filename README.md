# 🎙️ SpeakerSplit – AI Voice Separation System
## 🔊 AI-Powered Multi-Speaker Voice Separation & Playback

SpeakerSplit is an AI-based audio processing application designed to separate mixed audio recordings containing multiple speakers into clean, isolated audio tracks.
Using advanced signal processing and machine learning clustering techniques, the system identifies different speakers, segments the audio, and reconstructs individual speaker tracks that users can play or download.

Built with **Streamlit** for the interface and leveraging powerful audio processing libraries like **librosa**, **scipy**, and **scikit-learn**, SpeakerSplit enables seamless audio upload, configuration, playback, and visual analysis.

## 🚀 Features
- Separate multiple overlapping voices from a single audio source
- Automatic speaker identification & clustering (2–6 speakers supported)
- Noise reduction, audio normalization & spectral filtering
- Individual speaker track export & playback dashboard
- Visual analysis: waveform & spectrogram preview
- User-configurable settings (noise level, speaker count, chunk size)

## 🏗 System Architecture

### **Frontend (UI Layer) – Streamlit Application**
| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| Framework | Streamlit |
| Layout | Multi-tab interface |
| Tabs | Upload & Process, Playback Dashboard, Analysis |
| State Management | Session state for audio, separated tracks, sample rate |
| Configurable Controls | Sidebar for noise reduction, normalization, speaker count |

---

### **Backend Architecture**
| Folder / Module | Responsibility |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `audio_processor.py` | Preprocessing (noise removal, normalization, filtering) |
| `speaker_separator.py` | Feature extraction, clustering, separation logic |
| `app.py` | Main orchestrator & UI integration |

### **Processing Pipeline**
1. Upload audio & convert format (`soundfile` / `pydub`)
2. Apply preprocessing (noise profile estimation, normalization)
3. Extract audio features (MFCC, spectral contrast, chroma, ZCR)
4. Segment audio into time-based chunks (~1 second)
5. Cluster speaker segments (`KMeans` / hierarchical clustering)
6. Rebuild separated tracks for each speaker
7. Output playback & download options
